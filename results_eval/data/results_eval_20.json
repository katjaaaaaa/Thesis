 "results": " 1. **Early Approaches to Paraphrase Generation**:\n   - **McKeown (1979)** and **Meteer and Shaked (1988)**: Early research included rule-based approaches.\n   - **Madnani and Dorr (2010)**: Introduced data-driven methods for paraphrase generation.\n\n2. **Neural Networks for Paraphrase Generation**:\n   - Recent approaches treat paraphrase generation as a sequence-to-sequence language generation task.\n   - **Prakash et al. (2016)**: Modified network structure to improve generation quality.\n\n3. **Improving Model Performance**:\n   - **Cao et al. (2017)**, **Wang et al. (2019)**, and **Kazemnejad et al. (2020)**: Proposed leveraging external resources to enhance model performance.\n\n4. **Incorporating Reinforcement and Unsupervised Learning**:\n   - **Li et al. (2018)**: Adopted reinforcement learning techniques.\n   - **Roy and Grangier (2019)**: Proposed unsupervised learning methods for paraphrase generation.\n\n5. **Incorporating Controllability into Generation Model**:\n   - Different approaches have been proposed to incorporate controllability.\n   - **Iyyer et al. (2018)**: Trained the model to produce paraphrased sentences with a given syntax.\n   - **Li et al. (2019)**: Adopted an external word aligner to train the model for paraphrasing at different levels.\n   - **Fu et al. (2019)**: The model generates paraphrases by planning the neighbour of words and realizing the complete sentence."
