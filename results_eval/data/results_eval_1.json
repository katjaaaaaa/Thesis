 "results": " 1. **Importance of NER in NLP**:\n   - Gupta et al. (2017): Named entity recognition (NER) is crucial for several downstream tasks such as entity linking.\n   - Mintz et al. (2009); Liu et al. (2017): NER is essential for relation extraction.\n   - Chang et al. (2013): NER plays a role in co-reference resolution.\n   - Ren et al. (2019): NER is significant for conversation systems.\n\n2. **Methods for Flat NER**:\n   - Lample et al. (2016); Ma and Hovy (2016); Strubell et al. (2017): Several methods have been proposed for flat named entity recognition.\n\n3. **Hand-crafted Features for Nested NER**:\n   - Zhang et al. (2004); Zhou et al. (2004); Zhou (2006): Early methods for nested entities rely on hand-crafted features or rule-based post-processing.\n\n4. **Hypergraph-based Method for Entity Mention Detection**:\n   - Lu and Roth (2015): Presented a novel hypergraph-based method for entity mention detection.\n   - Muis and Lu (2017): Improved Lu and Roth's method by incorporating mention separators and features.\n\n5. **Stacking Sequence Model for Nested NER**:\n   - Alex et al. (2007): Proposed several conditional random field (CRF)-based methods for the GENIA dataset.\n   - Finkel and Manning (2009): Presented a chart-based parsing method for named entity recognition.\n   - Ju et al. (2018): Dynamically stacked flat NER layers to extract nested entities.\n\n6. **Limitations of Sequence Models for Nested NER**:\n   - CRF-based methods (Alex et al., 2007; Finkel and Manning, 2009): Cannot recognize nested entities of the same type and are not scalable.\n\n7. **Transition-based Model for Nested Mention Detection**:\n   - Wang et al. (2018): Presented a transition-based model for nested mention detection using a forest representation.\n\n8. **Exhaustive Method for Entity Type Detection**:\n   - Sohrab and Miwa (2018): Considered all possible regions in a sentence for entity type detection.\n\n9. **Our Model for Nested NER**:\n   - Authors of the paper: Our model focuses on boundary-relevant regions for nested entity detection, leveraging boundary information for precise entity location."
