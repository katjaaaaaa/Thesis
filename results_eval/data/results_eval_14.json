 "results": " 1. **Challenges in NER for the Legal Domain**:\n   - The development of NER approaches in the legal domain is fragmented and inconsistent.\n   - There is no consensus on selecting relevant semantic categories from the legal domain.\n   - Corpora or datasets of legal documents with annotated named entities are lacking.\n   - **Dozier et al. (2010)**: Described five classes for taggers based on dictionary lookup, pattern-based rules, and statistical models. These classes include jurisdiction, court, title, doctype, and judge.\n   - **Cardellino et al. (2017)**: Developed an ontology of legal concepts using NERC, LKIF, and YAGO classes. Entities were divided into abstraction, act, document, organization, person, and non-entity.\n   - **Glaser et al. (2018)**: Utilized GermaNER and DBpedia Spotlight for recognizing person, location, and organization entities. Created an evaluation dataset of 20 court decisions.\n\n2. **Contributions of Authors**:\n   - **Dozier et al.
