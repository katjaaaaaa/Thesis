(1995)**: Contributed to the understanding of catastrophic forgetting.\n   - **Ratcliff (1990)**: Added to the body of knowledge on catastrophic forgetting.\n   - **Existing Research Directions**:\n     - **Memory-based Approach**:\n       - **LopezPaz and Ranzato (2017)**: Introduced memory-based approach to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.\n       - **Anonymous (2019)**: Contributed to the memory-based approach.\n     - **Consolidation of Parameters**:\n       - **Kirkpatrick et al. (2016)**: Proposed Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to slow down learning on important weights.\n       - **Liu et al. (2018)**: Contributed to the consolidation of parameters approach.\n       - **Ritter et al. (2018)**: Added to the consolidation of parameters approach.\n       - **Zenke et al. (2017)**: Contributed to the consolidation of parameters approach.\n   - **Lifelong Learning with Dynamic Model Architecture**:\n     - **Xiao et al. (2014)**: Introduced dynamic model architecture to prevent forgetting.\n     - **Rusu et al. (2016)**: Contributed to the dynamic model architecture approach.\n     - **Fernando et al. (2017)**: Added to the dynamic model architecture approach.\n\n2. **Lifelong Learning in NLP**:\n   - **Chen et al. (2015)** and **Chen, 2015**: Focused on representing, reserving, and extracting knowledge of previous tasks in NLP.\n   - **Shu et al. (2016, 2017)**: Contributed to the research direction on representing, reserving, and extracting knowledge in NLP.\n   - **Remark**: These works belong to a different research direction than lifelong learning without catastrophic forgetting."
