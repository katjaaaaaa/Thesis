 "results": " 1. **Building on Prior Efforts**:\n   - **Handler and O'Connor (2018)**: Proposed a two-stage process for extractively summarizing relationships, identifying wellformed spans and choosing the best summary statement from these candidates.\n\n2. **New Task of Choosing the Best Summary Statement**:\n   - **Authors of the paper**: Approach the task of selecting the best summary statement from available candidates by collecting new supervision tailored to summarizing relationships on concept maps.\n\n3. **Differentiation from Existing Concept Map Dataset**:\n   - **Authors of the paper**: Contrast their work with Falke and Gurevych (2017) by focusing on finding the best summary relationship for a given relationship, rather than creating the best overall concept map for a topic.\n\n   - **Falke and Gurevych (2017)**: Created a concept map dataset aiming to generate the best overall concept map for a given topic.\n\n   - **Authors of the paper**: Their dataset includes labels for the most readable and informative statement describing the relationship between a (t) \\u2212 (t) query pair, which differs from Falke and Gurevych's dataset."
