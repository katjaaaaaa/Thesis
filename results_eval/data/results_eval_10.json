 "results": " 1. **Topic Labelling Methods**:\n   - Generate candidate labels for a given topic (text or images).\n   - Rank candidate labels by relevance to the topic.\n   - Authors contributing to this topic:\n     - Mei et al., 2007: Sourced textual labels from noun chunks in a reference corpus.\n     - Lau et al., 2011; Aletras and Stevenson, 2014; Bhatia et al., 2016: Sourced textual labels from Wikipedia article titles.\n     - Cano Basave et al., 2014; Wan and Wang, 2016: Sourced textual labels from short text summaries.\n     - Aletras and Stevenson, 2013; Aletras and Mittal, 2017: Selected images based on querying with topic words.\n     - Bhatia et al., 2016: Used text and image embeddings to improve candidate label generation and ranking.\n     - Aletras and Mittal, 2017: Used pre-computed dependency-based word embeddings and image embeddings for topic labelling.\n     - Authors of the paper: Proposed a joint model for multimodal topic labelling.\n\n2. **Recent Work on Topic Labelling**:\n   - Recent work has shown that text or image embeddings can improve candidate label generation and ranking.\n   - Authors contributing to this topic:\n     - Bhatia et al., 2016: Used word2vec and doc2vec to represent topics and candidate textual labels in the same latent semantic space.\n     - Aletras and Mittal, 2017: Used pre-computed dependency-based word embeddings and image embeddings for topic labelling.\n     - Authors of the paper: Used a joint model to predict the continuous-valued rating for both textual and image labels.\n\n3. **Textual or Visual Modalities for Labelling Topics**:\n   - Textual or visual modalities for labelling topics have been studied extensively, although independently from one another.\n   - Authors contributing to this topic: Authors of the paper: Proposed a joint model for multimodal topic labelling."
