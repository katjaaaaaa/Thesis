Text: "This study builds on prior efforts from Handler and O'Connor (2018), who propose extractively summarizing relationships via a two-stage process that first (1) identifies wellformed spans from a corpus that start with (t) and end with (t) and then (2) chooses the best summary statement from among these wellformed candidates.  Handler and O'Connor (2018) show that extracting wellformed spans can find many more readable candidates than traditional relation extraction techniques.  But they do not offer a method for the second step of picking a summary statement, which is the focus of this study.   We approach this new task of choosing the best summary statement from available candidates by collecting new supervision, tailored to the particular problem of summarizing relationships on concept maps.  This form of supervision has a different focus from the existing Falke and Gurevych (2017) concept map dataset.  Where Falke and Gurevych (2017) seek to create the best overall concept map for a given topic, this work seeks to find the best summary relationship for a given relationship.  Therefore, unlike Falke and Gurevych (2017), our dataset includes labels for the most readable and informative statement describing the relationship between a (t) \u2212 (t) query pair. "<|end|>
