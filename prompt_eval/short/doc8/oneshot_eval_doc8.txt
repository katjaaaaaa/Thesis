Text: "Eye-tracking for NLP.  Eye-tracking data have proved to be associated with language comprehension activity in human brains by numerous research in neuroscience (Rayner, 1998;Henderson and Ferreira, 1993).  In cognitively motivated NLP, several studies have investigated the impact of eye-tracking data on NLP tasks.  In early works, these signals have been used in machine learning approaches to NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging (Barrett et al., 2016), multiword expression extraction (Rohanian et al., 2017), syntactic category prediction (Barrett and Sgaard, 2015).  In neural models, eyetracking data are combined with word embeddings to improve various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis (Mishra et al., 2017) and NER (Hollenstein and Zhang, 2019).  Eye-tracking data have also been used to enhance or constrain neural attention in (Barrett et al., 2018;Sood et al., 2020b,a; Takmaz et al., 2020).   EEG for NLP.  Electroencephalography (EEG) measures potentials fluctuations caused by the activity of neurons in cerebral cortex.  The exploration of EEG data in NLP tasks is relatively limited.  Chen et al. (2012) improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) by using EEG signals to classify the speaker's mental state.  Hollenstein et al. (2019a) incorporate EEG signals into NLP tasks, including NER, relation extraction and sentiment analysis.  Additionally, Muttenthaler et al. (2020) leverage EEG features to regularize attention on relation extraction.   Adversarial Learning.  The concept of adversarial training originates from the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) in computer vision.  Since then, it has been also applied in NLP (Denton et al., 2015;Ganin et al., 2016).  Recently, a great variety of studies attempt to introduce adversarial training into multi-task learning in NLP tasks, such as Chinese NER (Cao et al., 2018), crowdsourcing learning (Yang et al., 2018), cross-lingual transfer learning (Chen et al., 2018;Kim et al., 2017), just name a few.  Different from these studies, we use adversarial learning to deeply align cognitive modality to textual modality at the sentence level. "<|end|>

Text: "Language models have proved to be a breakthrough in analyzing a person's emotional state.  We now describe briefly some of these highly influential works.  subsection(2.1 Pre-trained Language Models)  Over the past few years, pre-trained language models have progressed greatly in learning contextualized representations.  Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), first proposed for machine translation, has enabled faster learning of complex representations of text.  GPT (Radford et al., 2018), BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) all leverage transformer architecture along with statistical tokenizers.  ELECTRA (Clark et al., 2020) a recent generator-discriminatorbased pre-training approach offers a competitive performance despite requiring lesser compute.  Domain specific language models also leads to a significant performance gain (Vaidhya and Kaushal, 2020;Lee et al., 2019;Beltagy et al., 2019).   subsection(2.2 Emotion Recognition)  Emotion recognition through facial expressions and speech data has been the subject of extensive study in the past.  (Tarnowski et al., 2017) presents an approach for recognition of seven emotional states based on facial expressions.  (Yoon et al., 2018) utilizes a novel deep dual recurrent encoder model to obtain a better understanding of speech data using text data and audio signals simultaneously.   For text, various approaches have been proposed for emotion recognition.  Deshmukh and Kirange (2012) proposed an SVM-based approach for predicting opinions on news headlines.  Acheampong et al. (2020) paper analyses the efficacy of utilizing transformer encoders for detecting emotions.  Kant et al. (2018) demonstrates the practical efficiency of large pre-trained language models for Multi-Emotion sentiment classification.   subsection(2.3 Computation of Empathy)  Empathy and distress are core components of a person's emotional state, and there has been a growing interest in computational approaches to model them.  Considering language variations across different regions, empathy and distress can also vary with demographics (Lin et al., 2018;Loveys et al., 2018), and recently (Guda et al., 2021) proposed a demographic-aware empathy modelling framework using BERT and demographics features.   Understanding empathy and distress are crucial for analyzing mental health and providing aid.  Recently (Sharma et al., 2020) explored language models for identifying empathetic conversations in the mental health support system. "<|end|>
