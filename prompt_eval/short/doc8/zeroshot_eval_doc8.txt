You are a summarization model. Generate a summary of a text taken from a scientific paper. Divide the summary into key concepts and/or subsections. Divide the summary into subsections. Use either subsections present in the text, or create subsections based on the key topics discussed in the text. Subsections must be placed in the chronological order. Per subsection, list the cited authors that contributed to the topic of the subsection in chronological order. The list must be in the bullet point form. The examples of how authors can be notated in the text are "Author et al. (2019)" or "(Author et al., 2017)". If no authors are introduced, assign the contribution to the authors of the paper the text was taken from. The structure of each contribution must be as following:
- Author at al. (2020): contribution
To notate the authors of the paper the text was taken from, use the following structure:
- Authors of the paper: contribution
Ensure that your answer is accurate and doesn't contain any information not directly supported by the text.

Text: "Language models have proved to be a breakthrough in analyzing a person's emotional state.  We now describe briefly some of these highly influential works.  subsection(2.1 Pre-trained Language Models)  Over the past few years, pre-trained language models have progressed greatly in learning contextualized representations.  Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), first proposed for machine translation, has enabled faster learning of complex representations of text.  GPT (Radford et al., 2018), BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) all leverage transformer architecture along with statistical tokenizers.  ELECTRA (Clark et al., 2020) a recent generator-discriminatorbased pre-training approach offers a competitive performance despite requiring lesser compute.  Domain specific language models also leads to a significant performance gain (Vaidhya and Kaushal, 2020;Lee et al., 2019;Beltagy et al., 2019).   subsection(2.2 Emotion Recognition)  Emotion recognition through facial expressions and speech data has been the subject of extensive study in the past.  (Tarnowski et al., 2017) presents an approach for recognition of seven emotional states based on facial expressions.  (Yoon et al., 2018) utilizes a novel deep dual recurrent encoder model to obtain a better understanding of speech data using text data and audio signals simultaneously.   For text, various approaches have been proposed for emotion recognition.  Deshmukh and Kirange (2012) proposed an SVM-based approach for predicting opinions on news headlines.  Acheampong et al. (2020) paper analyses the efficacy of utilizing transformer encoders for detecting emotions.  Kant et al. (2018) demonstrates the practical efficiency of large pre-trained language models for Multi-Emotion sentiment classification.   subsection(2.3 Computation of Empathy)  Empathy and distress are core components of a person's emotional state, and there has been a growing interest in computational approaches to model them.  Considering language variations across different regions, empathy and distress can also vary with demographics (Lin et al., 2018;Loveys et al., 2018), and recently (Guda et al., 2021) proposed a demographic-aware empathy modelling framework using BERT and demographics features.   Understanding empathy and distress are crucial for analyzing mental health and providing aid.  Recently (Sharma et al., 2020) explored language models for identifying empathetic conversations in the mental health support system. "<|end|>
