Text: "Eye-tracking for NLP.  Eye-tracking data have proved to be associated with language comprehension activity in human brains by numerous research in neuroscience (Rayner, 1998;Henderson and Ferreira, 1993).  In cognitively motivated NLP, several studies have investigated the impact of eye-tracking data on NLP tasks.  In early works, these signals have been used in machine learning approaches to NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging (Barrett et al., 2016), multiword expression extraction (Rohanian et al., 2017), syntactic category prediction (Barrett and Sgaard, 2015).  In neural models, eyetracking data are combined with word embeddings to improve various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis (Mishra et al., 2017) and NER (Hollenstein and Zhang, 2019).  Eye-tracking data have also been used to enhance or constrain neural attention in (Barrett et al., 2018;Sood et al., 2020b,a; Takmaz et al., 2020).   EEG for NLP.  Electroencephalography (EEG) measures potentials fluctuations caused by the activity of neurons in cerebral cortex.  The exploration of EEG data in NLP tasks is relatively limited.  Chen et al. (2012) improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) by using EEG signals to classify the speaker's mental state.  Hollenstein et al. (2019a) incorporate EEG signals into NLP tasks, including NER, relation extraction and sentiment analysis.  Additionally, Muttenthaler et al. (2020) leverage EEG features to regularize attention on relation extraction.   Adversarial Learning.  The concept of adversarial training originates from the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) in computer vision.  Since then, it has been also applied in NLP (Denton et al., 2015;Ganin et al., 2016).  Recently, a great variety of studies attempt to introduce adversarial training into multi-task learning in NLP tasks, such as Chinese NER (Cao et al., 2018), crowdsourcing learning (Yang et al., 2018), cross-lingual transfer learning (Chen et al., 2018;Kim et al., 2017), just name a few.  Different from these studies, we use adversarial learning to deeply align cognitive modality to textual modality at the sentence level. "<|end|>

Text: "This study builds on prior efforts from Handler and O'Connor (2018), who propose extractively summarizing relationships via a two-stage process that first (1) identifies wellformed spans from a corpus that start with (t) and end with (t) and then (2) chooses the best summary statement from among these wellformed candidates.  Handler and O'Connor (2018) show that extracting wellformed spans can find many more readable candidates than traditional relation extraction techniques.  But they do not offer a method for the second step of picking a summary statement, which is the focus of this study.   We approach this new task of choosing the best summary statement from available candidates by collecting new supervision, tailored to the particular problem of summarizing relationships on concept maps.  This form of supervision has a different focus from the existing Falke and Gurevych (2017) concept map dataset.  Where Falke and Gurevych (2017) seek to create the best overall concept map for a given topic, this work seeks to find the best summary relationship for a given relationship.  Therefore, unlike Falke and Gurevych (2017), our dataset includes labels for the most readable and informative statement describing the relationship between a (t) \u2212 (t) query pair. "<|end|>
