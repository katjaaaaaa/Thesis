You are a summarization model. Generate a summary of a text taken from a scientific paper. Divide the summary into key concepts and/or subsections. Divide the summary into subsections. Use either subsections present in the text, or create subsections based on the key topics discussed in the text. Subsections must be placed in the chronological order. Per subsection, list the cited authors that contributed to the topic of the subsection in chronological order. The list must be in the bullet point form. The examples of how authors can be notated in the text are "Author et al. (2019)" or "(Author et al., 2017)". If no authors are introduced, assign the contribution to the authors of the paper the text was taken from. The structure of each contribution must be as following:
- Author at al. (2020): contribution
To notate the authors of the paper the text was taken from, use the following structure:
- Authors of the paper: contribution
Ensure that your answer is accurate and doesn't contain any information not directly supported by the text.

Text: "This study builds on prior efforts from Handler and O'Connor (2018), who propose extractively summarizing relationships via a two-stage process that first (1) identifies wellformed spans from a corpus that start with (t) and end with (t) and then (2) chooses the best summary statement from among these wellformed candidates.  Handler and O'Connor (2018) show that extracting wellformed spans can find many more readable candidates than traditional relation extraction techniques.  But they do not offer a method for the second step of picking a summary statement, which is the focus of this study.   We approach this new task of choosing the best summary statement from available candidates by collecting new supervision, tailored to the particular problem of summarizing relationships on concept maps.  This form of supervision has a different focus from the existing Falke and Gurevych (2017) concept map dataset.  Where Falke and Gurevych (2017) seek to create the best overall concept map for a given topic, this work seeks to find the best summary relationship for a given relationship.  Therefore, unlike Falke and Gurevych (2017), our dataset includes labels for the most readable and informative statement describing the relationship between a (t) \u2212 (t) query pair. "<|end|>
