Text: "Eye-tracking for NLP.  Eye-tracking data have proved to be associated with language comprehension activity in human brains by numerous research in neuroscience (Rayner, 1998;Henderson and Ferreira, 1993).  In cognitively motivated NLP, several studies have investigated the impact of eye-tracking data on NLP tasks.  In early works, these signals have been used in machine learning approaches to NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging (Barrett et al., 2016), multiword expression extraction (Rohanian et al., 2017), syntactic category prediction (Barrett and Sgaard, 2015).  In neural models, eyetracking data are combined with word embeddings to improve various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis (Mishra et al., 2017) and NER (Hollenstein and Zhang, 2019).  Eye-tracking data have also been used to enhance or constrain neural attention in (Barrett et al., 2018;Sood et al., 2020b,a; Takmaz et al., 2020).   EEG for NLP.  Electroencephalography (EEG) measures potentials fluctuations caused by the activity of neurons in cerebral cortex.  The exploration of EEG data in NLP tasks is relatively limited.  Chen et al. (2012) improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) by using EEG signals to classify the speaker's mental state.  Hollenstein et al. (2019a) incorporate EEG signals into NLP tasks, including NER, relation extraction and sentiment analysis.  Additionally, Muttenthaler et al. (2020) leverage EEG features to regularize attention on relation extraction.   Adversarial Learning.  The concept of adversarial training originates from the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) in computer vision.  Since then, it has been also applied in NLP (Denton et al., 2015;Ganin et al., 2016).  Recently, a great variety of studies attempt to introduce adversarial training into multi-task learning in NLP tasks, such as Chinese NER (Cao et al., 2018), crowdsourcing learning (Yang et al., 2018), cross-lingual transfer learning (Chen et al., 2018;Kim et al., 2017), just name a few.  Different from these studies, we use adversarial learning to deeply align cognitive modality to textual modality at the sentence level. "<|end|>

Text: "Topic labelling methods usually involve two main steps: (1) the generation of candidate labels (e.g.  text or images) for a given topic; and (2) the ranking of candidate labels by relevance to the topic.  Textual labels have been sourced from in a number of different ways, including noun chunks from a reference corpus (Mei et al., 2007), Wikipedia ar ticle titles (Lau et al., 2011;Aletras and Stevenson, 2014;Bhatia et al., 2016), or short text summaries (Cano Basave et al., 2014;Wan and Wang, 2016).  Images are often selected from Wikipedia or the web based on querying with topic words (Aletras and Stevenson, 2013;Aletras and Mittal, 2017).  Recent work on topic labelling has shown that text or image embeddings can improve candidate label generation and ranking (Bhatia et al., 2016;Aletras and Mittal, 2017).   Bhatia et al. (2016) use word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and doc2vec (Le and Mikolov, 2014) to represent topics and candidate textual labels in the same latent semantic space.  The most relevant textual labels for a topic are selected from Wikipedia article titles using the cosine similarity between the topic and article title embeddings.  Finally, top labels are re-ranked in a supervised fashion using various features such as the PageRank score of the article in Wikipedia (Brin and Page, 1998), trigram letter ranking (Kou et al., 2015), topic word overlap, and word length of the label.   Aletras and Mittal (2017) use pre-computed dependency-based word embeddings (Levy and Goldberg, 2014) to represent the topics and the caption of the images, as well as image embeddings using the output layer of VGG-net (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014) pretrained on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009).  A concatenation of these three vectors is the input to a simple deep neural network with four hidden layers and a sigmoid output layer to predict the relevance score.   Textual or visual modalities for labelling topics have been studied extensively, although independently from one another.  Our work differs from the single-modality methods described above in that it uses a joint model to predict the continuousvalued rating for both textual and image labels.  This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt at joint multimodal topic labelling. "<|end|>
