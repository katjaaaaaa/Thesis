You are a summarization model. Generate a summary of a text taken from a scientific paper. Divide the summary into key concepts and/or subsections. Divide the summary into subsections. Use either subsections present in the text, or create subsections based on the key topics discussed in the text. Subsections must be placed in the chronological order. Per subsection, list the cited authors that contributed to the topic of the subsection in chronological order. The list must be in the bullet point form. The examples of how authors can be notated in the text are "Author et al. (2019)" or "(Author et al., 2017)". If no authors are introduced, assign the contribution to the authors of the paper the text was taken from. The structure of each contribution must be as following:
- Author at al. (2020): contribution
To notate the authors of the paper the text was taken from, use the following structure:
- Authors of the paper: contribution
Ensure that your answer is accurate and doesn't contain any information not directly supported by the text.

Text: "Topic labelling methods usually involve two main steps: (1) the generation of candidate labels (e.g.  text or images) for a given topic; and (2) the ranking of candidate labels by relevance to the topic.  Textual labels have been sourced from in a number of different ways, including noun chunks from a reference corpus (Mei et al., 2007), Wikipedia ar ticle titles (Lau et al., 2011;Aletras and Stevenson, 2014;Bhatia et al., 2016), or short text summaries (Cano Basave et al., 2014;Wan and Wang, 2016).  Images are often selected from Wikipedia or the web based on querying with topic words (Aletras and Stevenson, 2013;Aletras and Mittal, 2017).  Recent work on topic labelling has shown that text or image embeddings can improve candidate label generation and ranking (Bhatia et al., 2016;Aletras and Mittal, 2017).   Bhatia et al. (2016) use word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and doc2vec (Le and Mikolov, 2014) to represent topics and candidate textual labels in the same latent semantic space.  The most relevant textual labels for a topic are selected from Wikipedia article titles using the cosine similarity between the topic and article title embeddings.  Finally, top labels are re-ranked in a supervised fashion using various features such as the PageRank score of the article in Wikipedia (Brin and Page, 1998), trigram letter ranking (Kou et al., 2015), topic word overlap, and word length of the label.   Aletras and Mittal (2017) use pre-computed dependency-based word embeddings (Levy and Goldberg, 2014) to represent the topics and the caption of the images, as well as image embeddings using the output layer of VGG-net (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014) pretrained on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009).  A concatenation of these three vectors is the input to a simple deep neural network with four hidden layers and a sigmoid output layer to predict the relevance score.   Textual or visual modalities for labelling topics have been studied extensively, although independently from one another.  Our work differs from the single-modality methods described above in that it uses a joint model to predict the continuousvalued rating for both textual and image labels.  This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt at joint multimodal topic labelling. "<|end|>
