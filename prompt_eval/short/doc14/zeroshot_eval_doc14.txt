You are a summarization model. Generate a summary of a text taken from a scientific paper. Divide the summary into key concepts and/or subsections. Divide the summary into subsections. Use either subsections present in the text, or create subsections based on the key topics discussed in the text. Subsections must be placed in the chronological order. Per subsection, list the cited authors that contributed to the topic of the subsection in chronological order. The list must be in the bullet point form. The examples of how authors can be notated in the text are "Author et al. (2019)" or "(Author et al., 2017)". If no authors are introduced, assign the contribution to the authors of the paper the text was taken from. The structure of each contribution must be as following:
- Author at al. (2020): contribution
To notate the authors of the paper the text was taken from, use the following structure:
- Authors of the paper: contribution
Ensure that your answer is accurate and doesn't contain any information not directly supported by the text.

Text: "Until now, NER has not received a lot of attention in the legal domain, developed approaches are fragmented and inconsistent with regard to their respective methods, datasets and typologies used.  Among the related work, there is no agreement regarding the selection of relevant semantic categories from the legal domain.  In addition, corpora or datasets of legal documents with annotated named entities do not appear to exist, which is, obviously, a stumbling block for the development of data-driven NER classifiers.  Dozier et al. (2010) describe five classes for which taggers are developed based on dictionary lookup, patternbased rules, and statistical models.  These are jurisdiction (a geographic area with legal authority), court, title (of a document), doctype (category of a document), and judge.  The taggers were tested with documents such as US case law, depositions, pleadings etc.  Cardellino et al. (2017) develop an ontology of legal concepts, making use of NERC (6 classes), LKIF (69 classes) and YAGO (358 classes).  On the NERC level, entities were divided in abstraction, act, document, organization, person, and non-entity.  With regard to LKIF, company, corporation, contract, statute etc.  are used.  Unfortunately, the authors do not provide any details regarding the questions how the entities were categorised or if there is any correlations between the different levels.  They work with Wikipedia articles and decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.  Glaser et al. (2018) use GermaNER (Benikova et al., 2015) and DBpedia Spotlight (Mendes et al., 2011;Daiber et al., 2013) for the recognition of person, location and organization entities.  References are identified based on the rules described by Landthaler et al. (2016).  The authors created an evaluation dataset of 20 court decisions. "<|end|>
