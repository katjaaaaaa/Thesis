You are a summarization model. Generate a summary of a text taken from a scientific paper. Divide the summary into key concepts and/or subsections. Divide the summary into subsections. Use either subsections present in the text, or create subsections based on the key topics discussed in the text. Subsections must be placed in the chronological order. Per subsection, list the cited authors that contributed to the topic of the subsection in chronological order. The list must be in the bullet point form. The examples of how authors can be notated in the text are "Author et al. (2019)" or "(Author et al., 2017)". If no authors are introduced, assign the contribution to the authors of the paper the text was taken from. The structure of each contribution must be as following:
- Author at al. (2020): contribution
To notate the authors of the paper the text was taken from, use the following structure:
- Authors of the paper: contribution
Ensure that your answer is accurate and doesn't contain any information not directly supported by the text.

Text: "Lifelong Learning without Catastrophic Forgetting Recent lifelong learning research mainly focuses on overcoming the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon (French, 1999;McCloskey and Cohen, 1989;McClell and et al., 1995;Ratcliff, 1990), i.e., knowledge of previous tasks is abruptly forgotten when learning on anew task.   Existing research mainly follow two directions: the first one is memory-based approach (LopezPaz and Ranzato, 2017;Anonymous, 2019), which saves some previous samples and optimizes anew task with a forgetting cost defined on the saved samples.  These methods have shown strength in alleviating catastrophic forgetting, but the computational cost grows rapidly with the number of previous tasks.  The second direction is to consolidate parameters that are important to previous tasks (Kirkpatrick et al., 2016;Liu et al., 2018;Ritter et al., 2018;Zenke et al., 2017).  For example, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) (Kirkpatrick et al., 2016) slows down learning on weights that are important to previous tasks.  These methods usually do not need to save any previous data and only train on each task once.  But their abilities to overcome catastrophic forgetting are limited.   Lifelong Learning with Dynamic Model Architecture There is another related direction on dynamically changing the model structure (i.e., adding new modules) in order to learn the new task without interfering learned knowledge for previous tasks, such as (Xiao et al., 2014;Rusu et al., 2016;Fernando et al., 2017).  These approaches could successfully prevent forgetting.  However, they do not suit many lifelong settings in NLP.  First, it cannot benefit from the positive transfer between tasks.  Second, the size of the model grows dramatically with the number of observed tasks, which makes it infeasible for real-world problems where there area lot of tasks.  Remark It is worth noting that the term lifelong learning is also widely used in (Chen et al., 2015;Chen, 2015;Shu et al., 2016, 2017), which mainly focus on how to represent, reserve and extract knowledge of previous tasks.  These works belong to a research direction different from lifelong learning without catastrophic forgetting. "<|end|>
