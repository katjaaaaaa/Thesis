Text: "Eye-tracking for NLP.  Eye-tracking data have proved to be associated with language comprehension activity in human brains by numerous research in neuroscience (Rayner, 1998;Henderson and Ferreira, 1993).  In cognitively motivated NLP, several studies have investigated the impact of eye-tracking data on NLP tasks.  In early works, these signals have been used in machine learning approaches to NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging (Barrett et al., 2016), multiword expression extraction (Rohanian et al., 2017), syntactic category prediction (Barrett and Sgaard, 2015).  In neural models, eyetracking data are combined with word embeddings to improve various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis (Mishra et al., 2017) and NER (Hollenstein and Zhang, 2019).  Eye-tracking data have also been used to enhance or constrain neural attention in (Barrett et al., 2018;Sood et al., 2020b,a; Takmaz et al., 2020).   EEG for NLP.  Electroencephalography (EEG) measures potentials fluctuations caused by the activity of neurons in cerebral cortex.  The exploration of EEG data in NLP tasks is relatively limited.  Chen et al. (2012) improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) by using EEG signals to classify the speaker's mental state.  Hollenstein et al. (2019a) incorporate EEG signals into NLP tasks, including NER, relation extraction and sentiment analysis.  Additionally, Muttenthaler et al. (2020) leverage EEG features to regularize attention on relation extraction.   Adversarial Learning.  The concept of adversarial training originates from the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) in computer vision.  Since then, it has been also applied in NLP (Denton et al., 2015;Ganin et al., 2016).  Recently, a great variety of studies attempt to introduce adversarial training into multi-task learning in NLP tasks, such as Chinese NER (Cao et al., 2018), crowdsourcing learning (Yang et al., 2018), cross-lingual transfer learning (Chen et al., 2018;Kim et al., 2017), just name a few.  Different from these studies, we use adversarial learning to deeply align cognitive modality to textual modality at the sentence level. "<|end|>

Text: "Lifelong Learning without Catastrophic Forgetting Recent lifelong learning research mainly focuses on overcoming the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon (French, 1999;McCloskey and Cohen, 1989;McClell and et al., 1995;Ratcliff, 1990), i.e., knowledge of previous tasks is abruptly forgotten when learning on anew task.   Existing research mainly follow two directions: the first one is memory-based approach (LopezPaz and Ranzato, 2017;Anonymous, 2019), which saves some previous samples and optimizes anew task with a forgetting cost defined on the saved samples.  These methods have shown strength in alleviating catastrophic forgetting, but the computational cost grows rapidly with the number of previous tasks.  The second direction is to consolidate parameters that are important to previous tasks (Kirkpatrick et al., 2016;Liu et al., 2018;Ritter et al., 2018;Zenke et al., 2017).  For example, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) (Kirkpatrick et al., 2016) slows down learning on weights that are important to previous tasks.  These methods usually do not need to save any previous data and only train on each task once.  But their abilities to overcome catastrophic forgetting are limited.   Lifelong Learning with Dynamic Model Architecture There is another related direction on dynamically changing the model structure (i.e., adding new modules) in order to learn the new task without interfering learned knowledge for previous tasks, such as (Xiao et al., 2014;Rusu et al., 2016;Fernando et al., 2017).  These approaches could successfully prevent forgetting.  However, they do not suit many lifelong settings in NLP.  First, it cannot benefit from the positive transfer between tasks.  Second, the size of the model grows dramatically with the number of observed tasks, which makes it infeasible for real-world problems where there area lot of tasks.  Remark It is worth noting that the term lifelong learning is also widely used in (Chen et al., 2015;Chen, 2015;Shu et al., 2016, 2017), which mainly focus on how to represent, reserve and extract knowledge of previous tasks.  These works belong to a research direction different from lifelong learning without catastrophic forgetting. "<|end|>
