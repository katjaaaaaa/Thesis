Text: "Eye-tracking for NLP.  Eye-tracking data have proved to be associated with language comprehension activity in human brains by numerous research in neuroscience (Rayner, 1998;Henderson and Ferreira, 1993).  In cognitively motivated NLP, several studies have investigated the impact of eye-tracking data on NLP tasks.  In early works, these signals have been used in machine learning approaches to NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging (Barrett et al., 2016), multiword expression extraction (Rohanian et al., 2017), syntactic category prediction (Barrett and Sgaard, 2015).  In neural models, eyetracking data are combined with word embeddings to improve various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis (Mishra et al., 2017) and NER (Hollenstein and Zhang, 2019).  Eye-tracking data have also been used to enhance or constrain neural attention in (Barrett et al., 2018;Sood et al., 2020b,a; Takmaz et al., 2020).   EEG for NLP.  Electroencephalography (EEG) measures potentials fluctuations caused by the activity of neurons in cerebral cortex.  The exploration of EEG data in NLP tasks is relatively limited.  Chen et al. (2012) improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) by using EEG signals to classify the speaker's mental state.  Hollenstein et al. (2019a) incorporate EEG signals into NLP tasks, including NER, relation extraction and sentiment analysis.  Additionally, Muttenthaler et al. (2020) leverage EEG features to regularize attention on relation extraction.   Adversarial Learning.  The concept of adversarial training originates from the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) in computer vision.  Since then, it has been also applied in NLP (Denton et al., 2015;Ganin et al., 2016).  Recently, a great variety of studies attempt to introduce adversarial training into multi-task learning in NLP tasks, such as Chinese NER (Cao et al., 2018), crowdsourcing learning (Yang et al., 2018), cross-lingual transfer learning (Chen et al., 2018;Kim et al., 2017), just name a few.  Different from these studies, we use adversarial learning to deeply align cognitive modality to textual modality at the sentence level. "<|end|>

Text: "Various approaches to the compositional generalization challenge posted by the CFQ dataset has been explored in prior or contemporary works, including Guo et al. (2020), Das et al. (2021), and Herzig et al. (2021).  These approaches are discussed in more detail in Section 4.   Another promising approach that has received relatively less attention so far is grammar induction, which can potentially derive grammar rules directly from question-query pairs.  Grammar induction methods, such as Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005), typically assumes a limited set of grammar rules to bootstrap the model, and then search some grammar spaces to find grammars that can lead to successful parsing of observed questions.   The idea of grammar induction has inspired various work that to different extent solved the SCAN dataset, such as Nye et al. (2020) or Chen et al. (2020).  The advantage of grammar induction methods is that they can potentially identify the complete set of transformation rules and thus attain perfect compositional generalization.  However, grammar induction methods are generally search-based, which limits their scalability to long sentences due to the size of search spaces.   Additionally, there has been considerable research in the semantic parsing literature to design neural network architectures that incorporate different query structures, including tree (Dong and Lapata, 2016), graph (Buys and Blunsom, 2017;Damonte et al., 2017;Lyu and Titov, 2018;Fancellu et al., 2019).  However, these architectures only incorporating query structures without incorporating syntactic structures in questions.  Our ablation study (Table 3) indicates that only incorporating query structure is insufficient for compositional generalization.  Our graph decoder alone only attains performance on bar with T5 models.   Similar to our work, Russin et al. (2019) also proposes to improve the compositional generalization of seq2seq models using attention.  However, their work only studies token-level attention without consideration of syntactic or semantic structures.  Both Russin et al. (2019) and Gordon et al. (2020) use part-of-speech (PoS) tags to attain some level of invariance among words that share the same PoS.   Finally, in the domain of semantic parsing, prior to Keysers et al. (2020), Finegan-Dollak et al. (2018) proposed to split datasets such that training and test sets contain no common SQL patterns.  Although this approach increases task difficulty, different SQL query patterns may still share similar substructures, which enables neural networks to solve the tasks relatively easily using the "mix-and-match" strategy (Lake and Baroni, 2018)."<|end|>
