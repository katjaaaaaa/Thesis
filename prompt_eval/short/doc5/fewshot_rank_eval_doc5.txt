Text: "Various approaches to the compositional generalization challenge posted by the CFQ dataset has been explored in prior or contemporary works, including Guo et al. (2020), Das et al. (2021), and Herzig et al. (2021).  These approaches are discussed in more detail in Section 4.   Another promising approach that has received relatively less attention so far is grammar induction, which can potentially derive grammar rules directly from question-query pairs.  Grammar induction methods, such as Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005), typically assumes a limited set of grammar rules to bootstrap the model, and then search some grammar spaces to find grammars that can lead to successful parsing of observed questions.   The idea of grammar induction has inspired various work that to different extent solved the SCAN dataset, such as Nye et al. (2020) or Chen et al. (2020).  The advantage of grammar induction methods is that they can potentially identify the complete set of transformation rules and thus attain perfect compositional generalization.  However, grammar induction methods are generally search-based, which limits their scalability to long sentences due to the size of search spaces.   Additionally, there has been considerable research in the semantic parsing literature to design neural network architectures that incorporate different query structures, including tree (Dong and Lapata, 2016), graph (Buys and Blunsom, 2017;Damonte et al., 2017;Lyu and Titov, 2018;Fancellu et al., 2019).  However, these architectures only incorporating query structures without incorporating syntactic structures in questions.  Our ablation study (Table 3) indicates that only incorporating query structure is insufficient for compositional generalization.  Our graph decoder alone only attains performance on bar with T5 models.   Similar to our work, Russin et al. (2019) also proposes to improve the compositional generalization of seq2seq models using attention.  However, their work only studies token-level attention without consideration of syntactic or semantic structures.  Both Russin et al. (2019) and Gordon et al. (2020) use part-of-speech (PoS) tags to attain some level of invariance among words that share the same PoS.   Finally, in the domain of semantic parsing, prior to Keysers et al. (2020), Finegan-Dollak et al. (2018) proposed to split datasets such that training and test sets contain no common SQL patterns.  Although this approach increases task difficulty, different SQL query patterns may still share similar substructures, which enables neural networks to solve the tasks relatively easily using the "mix-and-match" strategy (Lake and Baroni, 2018)."<|end|>
