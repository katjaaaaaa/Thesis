 "zeroshot": " Key Concepts and Contributions:\n\n1. HappyDB:\n   - *Authors of the paper*: HappyDB is the first crowdsourced corpus of happy moments, designed to understand the language used to describe happy events.\n\n2. Crowdsourced Datasets in Mental Health:\n   - Althoff et al. (Althoff et al., 2016): Conducted a large-scale analysis on counseling conversational logs from SMS for mental illness study, exploring the correlation between linguistic aspects and conversation outcomes.\n   - Mihalcea et al. (Mihalcea and Liu, 2006): Performed text analysis on blog posts from LiveJournal, where posts can be tagged as happy or sad, to study emotional expression.\n   - Lin et al. (Lin et al., 2016): Measured stress from short texts by identifying stressors and stress levels, classifying tweets into 12 stress categories based on the stress scale by Holmes and Rahe (1967).\n\n3. Crowdsourced Research Efforts and Natural Language Techniques:\n   - Rajpurkar et al. (Rajpurkar et al., 2016): Created a large-scale dataset for question-answering (SQuAD) by crowdsourcing workers to generate questions based on Wikipedia paragraphs.\n   - HappyDB vs. SQuAD:\n     - *Authors of the paper*: HappyDB, similar to SQuAD in terms of dataset scale, but designed for more open-ended problems compared to SQuAD's specific focus on question-answering.",
 "oneshot": " **HappyDB: Crowdsourced Corpus of Happy Moments**\n\n        - **Authors of the Paper**: HappyDB is the first crowdsourced corpus of happy moments which can be used for understanding the language people use to describe happy events. It is cognitively easier than SQuAD's task and aims to avoid bias in the corpus.\n\n        **Previous Works in Mental Health Dataset Creation**\n\n        - **Althoff et al. (2016)**: Conducted a large scale analysis on counseling conversational logs collected from SMS for mental illness study. They studied how various linguistic aspects of conversations are correlated with conversation outcomes.\n        - **Mihalcea et al. (2006)**: Performed text analysis on blog posts from LiveJournal, where posts can be assigned happy/sad tags by their authors.\n        - **Lin et al. (2016)**: Measured stress from short texts by identifying stressors and stress levels. They classified tweets into 12 stress categories defined by the stress scale in (Holmes and Rahe, 1967).\n        - **Rajpurkar et al. (2016)**: Created a large-scale dataset for question-answering (SQuAD) by crowdsourcing workers to create questions based on paragraphs obtained from Wikipedia.\n\n        **HappyDB vs. SQuAD**\n\n        - **Authors of the Paper**: HappyDB is similar to SQuAD in terms of the scale of the crowdsourced dataset. However, unlike SQuAD, which was designed specifically for studying the question answering problem, the problems that HappyDB can be used for are more open-ended.",

(2016)**: Measured stress from short texts, classifying tweets into categories based on a stress scale.\n\n    **Crowdsourced Datasets and Quality Control**\n\n    - **Rajpurkar et al. (2016)**: Created SQuAD, employing MTurk workers with high approval ratings for dataset quality.\n    - *Authors of the paper*: Ensured high-quality crowdsourced dataset for studying question-answering.\n\n    **HappyDB Methodology**\n\n    - *Authors of the paper*: Selected workers without considering qualifications to avoid bias, focusing on tasks that are less demanding than those in SQuAD.\n\n    **Purpose and Scope**\n\n    - *Authors of the paper*: HappyDB is designed for a broader range of applications, unlike SQuAD's specific focus on question-answering.",
