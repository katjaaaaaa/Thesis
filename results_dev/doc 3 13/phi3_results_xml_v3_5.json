There has been recent interest in creating datasets in the area of mental health.  Althoff et al. (Althoff et al., 2016): conducted a large scale analysis on counseling conversational logs collected from short message services (SMS) for mental illness study.  They studied how various linguistic aspects of conversations are correlated with conversation outcomes.  Mihalcea et al. (Mihalcea and Liu, 2006): performed text analysis on blog posts from LiveJournal (where posts can be assigned happy/sad tags by their authors).  Lin et al. (Lin et al., 2016): measure stress from short texts by identifying the stressors and the stress levels.  They classified tweets into 12 stress categories defined by the stress scale in (Holmes and Rahe, 1967).  Last year alone, there were multiple research efforts that obtained datasets via crowdsourcing and applied natural language techniques to understand different corpora.  For example, SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016): created a largescale dataset for question-answering.  The crowdsourced workers were asked to create questions based on a paragraph obtained from Wikipedia.  They employed MTurk workers with strong experience and a high approval rating to ensure the quality of the dataset.  We did not select the workers based on their qualification for HappyDB as our task is cognitively easier than SQuAD's and we want to avoid bias in our corpus.  HappyDB is similar to SQuAD in terms of the scale of the crowdsourced dataset.

One of the key areas of interest is the analysis of language used in social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook. These platforms provide a rich source of data for linguistic analysis, as they contain a vast amount of text generated by users from diverse backgrounds. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze this data. NLP techniques can be used to extract meaningful information from the text, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition. These techniques have been applied to a wide range of research questions, including the study of public opinion, the analysis of political discourse, and the detection of fake news. The use of NLP techniques in social media analysis has also raised important ethical and privacy concerns. For example, the use of personal data for research purposes without the consent of the users has been a subject of debate. Despite these concerns, the use of NLP techniques in social media analysis has the potential to provide valuable insights into human behavior and communication. \"\n    </input>\n</prompt>\n\n<summary>\n    - Authors of the paper: The study of human language and communication has been a central focus of research in the field of linguistics.

One is focusing on utterance-level multimodal feature fusion.  These methods use the features of the overall utterance.  For example, they first extract the frame-level visual or acoustic features and then average them to obtain the final features, which are called utterance-level features.  The utterance-level textual features can be obtained by applying RNNs for words.  The obtained utterance-level features are fed into the fusion model to get the multimodal representation.  Some models have been proposed for effective multimodal feature fusion.  Zadeh et al. (2017) proposed Tensor Fusion to explicitly capture unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal interactions.  But this method uses the three-fold Cartesian product to fuse the multimodal features, which makes the",

(2016)**: Created SQuAD, a large-scale dataset for question-answering, using MTurk workers with high approval ratings to ensure quality.\n\nUnlike SQuAD, which targets question-answering, HappyDB is tailored for more open-ended applications and was not selected based on worker qualifications to avoid bias, despite its large-scale crowdsourced nature.
