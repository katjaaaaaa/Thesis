 "oneshot": " 1. **Noisy Channel Models (NCMs) for Disfluency Detection**:\n   - **Johnson and Charniak (2004)** and **Johnson et al. (2004)**: Developed NCMs using complex tree adjoining grammar (TAG) based channel models to find \"rough copy\" dependencies between words.\n   - **Johnson and Charniak (2004)**: Introduced a syntactic parser-based language model sensitive to global properties of the sentence.\n   - **Johnson et al. (2004)**: Proposed rescoring n-best analyses with external n-gram and deep learning language models to improve baseline NCM performance.\n\n2. **Parsing-based Approaches**:\n   - **Rasooli and Tetreault (2013)**: Augmented a transition-based dependency parser with an action to detect and remove disfluent parts of the sentence and their dependencies.\n   - **Honnibal and Johnson (2014)**: Developed a parsing-based approach for disfluency detection.\n   - **Yoshikawa et al.

 "fewshot_rankings": " 1. **Noisy Channel Models for Disfluency Detection**:\n   - **Johnson and Charniak (2004)**: Utilized a TAG-based channel model for disfluency detection.\n   - **Johnson et al. (2004)**: Combined TAG channel model with a bigram LM for n-best disfluency analyses and reranking.\n   - **Zwarts and Johnson (2011)**: Proposed using external n-gram LMs and deep learning LMs for improving NCM performance.\n\n2. **Parsing-Based Approaches**:\n   - Detect disfluencies and identify syntactic structure simultaneously (Rasooli and Tetreault, 2013;Honnibal and Johnson, 2014;Yoshikawa et al., 2016).\n   - Require large annotated treebanks for training.\n\n3. **Sequence Tagging Approaches**:\n   - Use various techniques like CRFs, HMMs, and deep learning models for labeling words as fluent or disfluent (Liu et al., 2006;Ostendorf and Hahn, 2013;Zayats et al., 2014;Ferguson et al., 2015).\n   - Extended baseline state space with repair states to handle disfluencies (Ostendorf and Hahn, 2013;Zayats et al., 2014, 2016).\n   - Contrast with the proposed model that labels words directly as fluent or disfluent without post-processing (not explicitly mentioned in the text).\n\n4. **Proposed Approach**:\n   - Based on an autocorrelational neural network (ACNN), this approach falls under sequence tagging methods.\n   - Aims to automatically capture dependencies without relying on hand-crafted features or representations from other models.\n   - Differentiates from Zayats et al. (2016) by not using a BLSTM and avoiding complex runtime dependencies.\n\n**Ranking Justification**:\n- The summary accurately reflects the structure of the paper, with clear distinctions between the three main categories and the proposed approach.\n- It correctly cites all authors and their contributions without adding any unsupported information.\n- The summary effectively highlights the relationship between the concepts and their respective contributions.\n- It avoids the complexities and issues present in lower-rated summaries, such as introducing unmentioned details or failing to capture the essence of the contributions.",
