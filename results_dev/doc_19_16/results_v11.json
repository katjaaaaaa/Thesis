 "oneshot": " 1. **Approaches to Disfluency Detection Task**:\n   - **Noisy Channel Models (NCMs)**:\n     - **Johnson and Charniak (2004)** and **Johnson et al. (2004)**: NCMs use tree adjoining grammar (TAG) based channel models to find dependencies between words.\n     - **Shieber and Schabes (1990)**: Provided the basis for TAG.\n     - **Zwarts and Johnson (2011)**: Showed that rescoring n-best analyses with external n-gram models improves NCM performance.\n     - **Jamshid Lou and Johnson (2017)**: Demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning LMs trained on large corpora.\n   - **Parsing-based Approaches**:\n     - **Rasooli and Tetreault (2013)**: Augmented a transition-based dependency parser to detect and remove disfluent parts.\n     - **Honnibal and Johnson (2014)**: Similar approach to augment dependency parsers.\n     - **Yoshikawa et al. (2016)**: Further developments in parsing-based approaches.\n   - **Sequence Tagging Approaches**:\n     - **Liu et al. (2006)**, **Ostendorf and Hahn (2013)**, **Zayats et al. (2014, 2016)**, **Ferguson et al. (2015)**, **Hough and Schlangen (2015)**, **Georgila (2009)**, **Georgila et al. (2010)**, **Zayats et al. (2016)**: These works used various models like conditional random fields, hidden Markov models, and deep learning models for sequence tagging.\n     - **Zayats et al. (2016)**: Investigated the performance of a bidirectional long-short term memory network (BLSTM) for disfluency detection.\n   - **Proposed Approach**:\n     - **Authors of the paper**: Proposed an autocorrelational neural network (ACNN) for disfluency detection, aiming to capture dependencies automatically without manually engineered features.\n     - **Similar work**: The approach is similar to recent work by Zayats et al. (2016) that used a BLSTM model for disfluency detection.",

(2016)**: Investigated BLSTM for disfluency detection, which underperformed compared to models with hand-crafted features.\n\n4. **Proposed Approach**:\n   - **Authors of the paper**: Introduced an ACNN for sequence tagging, labeling words directly as fluent or disfluent without post-processing.\n   - **Contrast with Zayats et al. (2016)**: Differentiated from their BLSTM model by avoiding manual features and aiming to automatically learn dependencies.",
