(2013, 2015)** explored the meaning of emoticons to aid sentiment analysis tasks.\n\n2. **Emojis as Sentiment Lexical Labels**:\n   - **Go et al. (2009)** and **Castellucci et al. (2015)** used emojis to label text for sentiment classification and lexicon construction.\n   - **Novak et al. (2015)** constructed lexicons and mapped sentiments for the 751 most used emojis.\n\n3. **Relationship Between Words and Emojis**:\n   - **Barbieri et al. (2017)** investigated predicting emojis from text-based tweets using Long Memory Short-Term networks (LSTMs).\n\n4. **Emojis Across Languages**:\n   - **Barbieri et al. (2016)** explored the meaning and use of emojis in four languages: American English, British English, Peninsular Spanish, and Italian.\n   - The researchers conducted experiments to compare the semantics of emojis across languages.\n\n5. **Proposal for Predicting Emojis from Tweets**:\n   - The authors propose a model capable of predicting emojis corresponding to tweets for the Semeval 2018 challenge (task 2, subtask 1).",
