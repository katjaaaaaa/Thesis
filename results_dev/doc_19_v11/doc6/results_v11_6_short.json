 "oneshot": " 1. **Event Detection**:\n   - **Chen et al. (2015)**, **Sha et al. (2016)**, **Nguyen et al. (2016)**, and **Lou et al. (2021)** contributed to the development of event detection methods based on neural networks.\n   - Neural networks are used to construct context features for candidate trigger words to classify events.\n   - Pre-trained language models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) have become essential in event detection models (Yang et al., 2019;Wadden et al., 2019;Shen et al., 2020).\n   - The study by **Lai et al. (2020b)** introduced a basic metric-based few-shot learning method for event detection.\n   - **Deng et al. (2020)** addressed few-shot learning for event classification using a dynamic memory network.\n   - Ontology embedding was used in event detection (ED) to enhance background knowledge (Deng et al., 2021).\n\n2. **Few-shot Learning and Meta-learning**:\n   - Fewshot learning involves training a model with limited labeled samples in a support set to predict labels of unlabeled samples in a query set.\n   - Approaches to fewshot learning fall into three categories: metric-based methods (Vinyals et al., 2016;Snell et al., 2017;Garcia and Bruna, 2012;Sung et al., 2018), optimization-based methods (Finn et al., 2017;Nichol et al., 2018;Ravi and Larochelle, 2016), and model-based methods (Yan et al., 2015;Zhang et al., 2018b; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015;Zhang et al., 2018a).\n   - **Ravi and Larochelle (2016)** introduced Bayesian meta-learning, which constructs the posterior distribution of the prototype vector using external information outside the support set.\n   - The method's effectiveness was demonstrated in few-shot relation extraction (Qu et al., 2020).\n   - The authors of the current study were inspired by Bayesian meta-learning to address the issue of insufficient sample diversity in few-shot event detection.\n   - However, the method introduced in the current study does not account for semantic deviation between knowledge and target types.",
