 "oneshot": ". **Multimodal Sentiment Analysis**:\n   - **Zadeh et al. (2017)** proposed Tensor Fusion for capturing interactions between unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal features. However, this method is time-consuming due to the Cartesian product used for feature fusion.\n   - **Liu et al. (2018)** introduced the Efficient Low-rank Multimodal Fusion to accelerate the fusion process by applying low-rank tensors.\n   - **Mai et al. (2020)** proposed a graph fusion network to model interactions between different modalities successively.\n   - **Zadeh et al. (2018a)** developed the Memory Fusion Network (MFN) to capture interactions across modalities and timesteps.\n   - **Wang et al. (2019)** proposed the Recurrent Attended Variation Embedding Network (RAVEN), which uses the Attention Gating module to dynamically fuse word-level features.\n   - **Tsai et al. (2019)** presented the multimodal transformer (Mult) that uses cross-modal attention to capture bimodal interactions.\n   - **Pham et al. (2019)** introduced the Multimodal Cyclic Translation Network (MCTN) to learn joint multimodal representations through translation tasks.\n   - The current study's model differs from MCTN by using crossmodal prediction tasks to distinguish shared and private non-textual features, obtaining more useful information by probing the cross-modal prediction model.\n\n2. **Feature Extraction and Fusion**:\n   - The text describes two approaches to multimodal sentiment analysis:\n     - **Utterance-level Feature Fusion**:\n       - **Zadeh et al. (2017)**: Tensor Fusion for capturing interactions between modalities.\n       - **Liu et al. (2018)**: Efficient Low-rank Multimodal Fusion for accelerating the fusion process.\n       - **Mai et al. (2020)**: Graph fusion network for modeling interactions between modalities.\n     - **Word-level Feature Fusion**:\n       - **Zadeh et al. (2018a)**: Memory Fusion Network (MFN) for capturing interactions across modalities and timesteps.\n       - **Wang et al. (2019)**: Recurrent Attended Variation Embedding Network (RAVEN) for dynamic fusion of word-level features.\n       - **Tsai et al. (2019)**: Multimodal transformer (Mult) for capturing bimodal interactions using cross-modal attention.\n   - The current study focuses on word-level features and uses crossmodal prediction tasks to distinguish shared and private non-textual features.",
 "fewshot_rankings": " 1. **HappyDB: Crowdsourced Corpus of Happy Moments**\n   - **Authors of the paper**: Created the first crowdsourced corpus of happy moments for studying language used in describing happy events.\n   - **Althoff et al. (2016)**: Conducted a large-scale analysis of counseling conversations from SMS to study linguistic correlations with outcomes.\n   - **Mihalcea et al. (2006)**: Analyzed blog posts from LiveJournal with happy/sad tags.\n   - **Lin et al. (2016)**: Measured stress from short texts, classifying tweets into categories based on a stress scale.\n   - **Comparison to SQuAD**: HappyDB, like SQuAD, is a large-scale crowdsourced dataset but is designed for more open-ended applications, unlike SQuAD's focus on question-answering.\n\n2. **Crowdsourced Datasets and Natural Language Processing**:\n   - **Rajpurkar et al. (2016)**: Created SQuAD, a large dataset for question-answering tasks.\n   - **Authors of the paper**: Employed MTurk workers to generate questions from Wikipedia paragraphs, ensuring high-quality dataset creation.\n   - **HappyDB**: Differentiated from SQuAD by focusing on cognitively easier tasks and avoiding worker qualification bias, aiming for a less biased corpus.\n\n**Ranking Justification**:\n- The summary accurately reflects the structure and content of the original text, maintaining a clear connection between concepts and their respective contributions.\n- It correctly cites the authors and their work without introducing any unsupported information.\n- The summary successfully captures the essence of the original text, providing a concise and accurate representation of the key points.",
 "fewshot_explanation": " 1. **HappyDB: Crowdsourced Corpus of Happy Moments**\n   - Authors of the paper: Developed the first crowdsourced corpus of happy moments for studying language used in happy events.\n   - Unique to HappyDB: Focused on understanding language describing happy events, unlike SQuAD which targets question-answering problems.\n   - Differentiation from SQuAD: HappyDB's tasks are more open-ended, not specifically designed for question-answering.\n\n2. **Previous Research on Mental Health Datasets**:\n   - Althoff et al. (Althoff et al., 2016): Conducted a large-scale analysis of counseling conversations from SMS to study linguistic correlations with outcomes.\n   - Mihalcea et al. (Mihalcea and Liu, 2006): Analyzed blog posts on LiveJournal with happy/sad tags.\n   - Lin et al. (Lin et al., 2016): Measured stress from short texts, classifying tweets into categories based on a stress scale.\n\n3. **Crowdsourced Datasets and Natural Language Processing**:\n   - Rajpurkar et al. (Rajpurkar et al., 2016): Created SQuAD, a large-scale dataset for question-answering tasks.\n   - Authors of the paper: Employed MTurk workers to generate questions from Wikipedia paragraphs, ensuring high-quality dataset through strong experience and high approval ratings.\n\n4. **Comparison with SQuAD**:\n   - Authors of the paper: Designed SQuAD for question-answering, unlike HappyDB's broader application scope.\n   - Differentiation from HappyDB: SQuAD's tasks are more specific, while HappyDB allows for a wider range of applications."
