# Results of the development set
This dolder is structured as follows:
- The first number of the folder represents the number of the document the _example summaries_ in the prompt were based on
- The second number of the folder represents the number of the document the _target summary_ was based on

In other words, in the __doc_13_3__ folder the summaries of document 3 are stored. The prompts contain the example summaries generated for document 13
