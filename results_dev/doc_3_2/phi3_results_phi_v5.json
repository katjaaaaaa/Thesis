 "zeroshot": " Subsection 2.1: Style Transfer\n- Style transfer is a task composed of two linked subtasks: paraphrasing and style adjustment.\n- The authors claim that the style transfer task consists mostly in good paraphrasing and much less in adding the target style.\n- The focus of the paper is on background methods for paraphrasing and then for style transfer.\n- Traditional paraphrasing methods include rule and dictionary-based approaches, as well as statistical paraphrase generation.\n- Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are used for automatic paraphrasing, with sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models being a popular choice.\n- The first paper presenting a deep learning model for the paraphrase task is by Prakash et al. (2016).\n- Other approaches to paraphrasing include variational autoencoders (VAEs) and deep reinforcement learning.\n- Insufficient corpora for paraphrase generation motivated new practical studies on unsupervised approaches.\n- Roy and Grangier (2019) proposed a monolingual system for paraphrasing and compared it to unsupervised and translation methods.\n\nAuthors of the paper: The authors of the paper focus on the paraphrasing and style transfer tasks, building upon previous research in the field.\n\nSubsection 2.2: Style Transfer Methods\n- Several existing solutions for style transfer are mentioned, including phrase-based MT methods, DNN seq2seq approaches, and adaptations of phrased-based and neural MT models for formality transfer.\n- A distinctive study using DNNs for both generation of style transfer phrases and their positions related to the input sentence is mentioned.\n- Another study conducted for text simplification (TS) task with the matched WikipediaSimple Wikipedia parallel data is also mentioned.\n- The authors draw inspiration from previous studies, such as Xu et al. (2012) and Alva-Manchego et al. (2019), for their measure propositions.\n- The authors' approach differs from previous solutions by training a multi-task model on a single language with paraphrases and a small neutral-to-style dataset.\n\nAuthors of the text: The authors of the text focus on the style transfer methods, building upon previous research in the field and drawing inspiration from previous studies.",
