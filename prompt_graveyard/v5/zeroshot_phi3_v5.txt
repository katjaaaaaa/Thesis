You are a summarization model. Generate a summary of a text taken from a scientific paper. Divide the summary into key concepts or subsections if explicitly stated in the text. Per concept/subsection list all cited authors in order they are presented in the text. Per author notate their contribution to the topic. The examples of how authors can be notated in the text are "Author et al. (2019)" or "(Author et al., 2017)" or "(Author et al., 2017; Author et al., 1998; Author et al., 2022)". If no authors are introduced, assign the contribution to the authors of the paper the text was taken from.
The contribution notation must follow this structure:
- Author at al. (2020): contribution
If multiple authors contribute to one point, use the following structure:
- Author et al. (2020), Author et al. (2023), Author et al. (2008), Author et al. (2033): contribution
To notate the authors of the text, use the following structure:
- Authors of the paper: contribution
Ensure that your answer is accurate and doesn't contain any information not directly supported by the text.

Text: 'subsection(2.1 Style transfer: not too far from paraphrasing)  Similarly to Xu et al. (2012) we see language ST as a task composed of two linked subtasks: paraphrasing and style adjustment.  In our paper we claim that the ST task consists mostly in good paraphrasing and much less in adding the target style.  Following this idea, we focus on background methods for the first task paraphrasing, and then for style transfer.   Traditionally, the paraphrasing task involved rule and dictionary-based approaches (McKeown, 1983;Bolshakov and Gelbukh, 2004;Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006).  Another popular method was the statistical paraphrase generation that recombined words probabilistically in order to create new sentences (Quirk et al., 2004;Wan et al., 2005;Zhao et al., 2009).  Currently, DNNs are used for automatic paraphrasing, e.g. by sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models (Sutskever et al., 2014).   Presumably, the first paper presenting a deep learning model for the paraphrase task is the one by Prakash et al. (2016).  The authors successfully compared their residual LSTM to previous LSTM-derived seq2seq models (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997;Schuster and Paliwal, 1997;Bahdanau et al., 2014;Vaswani et al., 2017).  In parallel, upon research on variational autoencoders (VAEs), e.g. Chung et al. (2015), other approaches to paraphrasing emerged (Bowman et al., 2016;Gupta et al., 2018).   More recently Li et al. (2018b) implemented paraphrase generation with deep reinforcement learning that proved better performance than the previous seq2seq results on Twitter (Lan et al., 2017) and Quora (Quora, 2017) datasets.  Insufficient corpora for paraphrase generation gave motivation to new practical studies on unsupervised approach (Artetxe et al., 2018;Conneau and Lample, 2019).  Recently, Roy and Grangier (2019) proposed a monolingual system for paraphrasing (without translation) and compared it to the unsupervised and translation methods, presenting various linguistic characteristics for each of them. subsection(2.2 Style transfer methods) We name here only some existing solutions.  Xu et al. (2012) used a phrase-based MT method on Shakespeare M2A corpus.  This research was followed by Jhamtani et al. (2017), who improved the results with the DNN seq2seq approach using a copy mechanism.   Rao and Tetreault (2018) adapted phrased-based and neural MT models for formality transfer using GYAFC corpus.  Later Niu et al. (2018) improved results on GYAFC by creating a multi-task system for both formality transfer and English-French MT.   It is worth mentioning Dryjanski et al. (2018) who used DNNs both elements: generation of ST phrases and their positions related to the input sentence.   Another distinctive study was conducted for text simplification (TS) task with the matched WikipediaSimple Wikipedia parallel data, e.g. Wubben et al. (2012;Wang et al. (2016).  What is significant for TS are the results for automatic measures in Xu et al. (2016) followed by Alva-Manchego et al. (2019).  We draw our inspiration from the authors, along with the results of Xu et al. (2012) in our measure propositions.   Our solution has common features with Wieting and Gimpel (2018).  The authors demonstrated that using pretrained embeddings from a large parallel paraphrase corpus (âˆ¼50 millions) and out-of-the-box models, it was possible to reach state-of-the-art results on several SemEval semantic textual similarity competitions.  In our work, instead of using pretrained embeddings we follow Johnson et al. (2017) and train the multi-task model on a single language, but with paraphrases and a small neutral-to-style dataset.  Compared to the previous solutions, our approach can be seen as a universal method to tackle text ST (e.g.  formality transfer, simplification and more).'<|end|>
