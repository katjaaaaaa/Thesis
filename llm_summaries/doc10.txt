    	- **Ionut Sorodoc et al. (2017)**: Introduced the concept of **multimodal topic labelling**.
    	- Traditional topic label systems focus on a single label modality (e.g., textual labels).
    	- Proposed a **multimodal approach** using a simple feedforward neural network.
    	- Automatically generates a rating for a candidate image or textual label relative to the topic.
    	- Demonstrated that this multimodal approach outperforms single-modality topic labelling systems.

	- **Contributions**:
    	- **Lau et al. (2011)**, **Bhatia et al. (2016)**: Proposed methods for topic interpretation based on **textual labels**.
    	- **Aletras and Stevenson (2013)**, **Aletras and Mittal (2017)**: Explored topic labelling using **images**.
    	- Recent work emphasized the use of **text or image embeddings** to improve candidate label generation and ranking.

    	- **Bhatia et al. (2016)**: Used **word2vec** and **doc2vec** to represent topics and textual labels in a shared latent semantic space.
    	- Selected relevant textual labels from Wikipedia article titles using **cosine similarity** between topic and article title embeddings.
    	- Re-ranked top labels using features like **PageRank score**, **trigram letter ranking**, topic word overlap, and label length.

4. **Image Representations and Neural Networks**:
	- **Contributions**:
    	- **Aletras and Mittal (2017)**: Utilized **dependency-based word embeddings** for topics and image captions.
    	- Extracted image embeddings using the output layer of **VGG-net** pretrained on **ImageNet**.
    	- Combined these vectors as input to a **deep neural network** for predicting relevance scores.

5. **Joint Multimodal Topic Labelling**:

## Key Concepts in Topic Labelling Methods

This scientific paper discusses two main steps involved in topic labelling methods and reviews different techniques used for generating and ranking candidate labels.

* **Two Main Steps in Topic Labelling**
	* Generating candidate labels (text or images) for a given topic.
	* Ranking candidate labels by their relevance to the topic.

* **Textual Labels**
	* Sourced from noun chunks in a reference corpus (Mei et al., 2007).
	* Extracted from Wikipedia article titles (Lau et al., 2011; Aletras and Stevenson, 2014; Bhatia et al., 2016).
	* Obtained from short text summaries (Cano Basave et al., 2014; Wan and Wang, 2016).

* **Image Labels**
	* Selected from Wikipedia or the web based on querying with topic words (Aletras and Stevenson, 2013; Aletras and Mittal, 2017).

* **Recent Advancements**
	* Text or image embeddings to improve candidate label generation and ranking (Bhatia et al., 2016; Aletras and Mittal, 2017).
    	* Bhatia et al. (2016): Used word2vec and doc2vec to represent topics and candidate labels in the same latent semantic space. Selected the most relevant textual labels from Wikipedia article titles using cosine similarity. Re-ranked top labels using features like PageRank score, trigram letter ranking, topic word overlap, and word length.
    	* Aletras and Mittal (2017): Used pre-computed dependency-based word embeddings to represent topics and image captions. Used image embeddings from the output layer of VGG-net pre-trained on ImageNet. Combined these three vectors as input to a deep neural network to predict the relevance score for both textual and image labels.

* **Our Work's Novelty**
	* This paper proposes a joint model to predict a continuous-valued rating for both textual and image labels, which is different from previous single-modality methods that focused on textual or visual labels independently.
