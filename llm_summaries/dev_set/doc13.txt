**Key Concepts:**

1. HappyDB: A crowdsourced corpus of happy moments used for analyzing language describing happiness.
2. Mental Health Datasets: Recent interest in creating datasets for mental health studies.
3. Counseling Conversational Logs: Analyzed by Althoff et al. (2016) to understand linguistic aspects correlated with conversation outcomes.
4. Blog Post Analysis: Conducted by Mihalcea and Liu (2006) on LiveJournal posts, categorizing them into happy/sad tags.
5. Stress Measurement from Short Texts: Lin et al. (2016) identified stressors and stress levels in tweets, classifying them into stress categories.
6. Crowdsourced Datasets: Various research efforts obtained datasets via crowdsourcing and applied natural language techniques.
7. SQuAD: Rajpurkar et al. (2016) created a large-scale question-answering dataset based on Wikipedia paragraphs, utilizing experienced MTurk workers.
8. Worker Selection for HappyDB: Workers were not selected based on qualification to avoid bias, unlike SQuAD's approach.
9. HappyDB vs. SQuAD: HappyDB is similar in scale but differs in its open-ended nature compared to SQuAD's specific question-answering focus.

**Contributions:**

1. Althoff et al. (2016): Analyzed counseling conversational logs to understand linguistic aspects correlated with conversation outcomes.
2. Mihalcea and Liu (2006): Conducted text analysis on LiveJournal posts, categorizing them into happy/sad tags.
3. Lin et al. (2016): Identified stressors and stress levels in tweets, classifying them into stress categories.
4. Rajpurkar et al. (2016): Created a large-scale question-answering dataset (SQuAD) from Wikipedia paragraphs using experienced MTurk workers.
5. Authors of the paper: Workers were not selected based on qualification to avoid bias in HappyDB's creation.
6. Authors of the paper: HappyDB, similar in scale to SQuAD, offers more open-ended applications compared to SQuAD's specific question-answering purpose.

## Key Concepts in HappyDB: A Crowdsourced Corpus of Happy Moments

**1. Motivation**

* Authors: Not mentioned in the excerpt
* Contribution: The paper describes the creation of HappyDB, a novel crowdsourced corpus of happy moments. This corpus aims to improve understanding of the language people use to describe positive experiences.

**2. Related Work**

* Authors: Althoff et al. (2016)
* Contribution: Analyzed counseling conversation logs to study how linguistic aspects of conversations correlate with mental health outcomes.

* Authors: Mihalcea and Liu (2006)
* Contribution: Performed text analysis on blog posts with assigned happy/sad tags to understand language use related to emotions.

* Authors: Lin et al. (2016)
* Contribution: Measured stress from short texts by identifying stressors and stress levels in tweets.

**3. Comparison with SQuAD Dataset**

* Authors: Rajpurkar et al. (2016)
* Contribution: Created a large-scale crowdsourced dataset (SQuAD) for question answering, where workers create questions based on Wikipedia passages.

* Authors: Not mentioned in the excerpt
* Contribution: HappyDB is similar to SQuAD in size but focuses on open ended exploration of happy moments through language, rather than a specific task like question answering.
