## Event Detection with Few-Shot Learning

This passage discusses event detection methods in the context of few-shot learning.

* **Neural Network-based Event Detection:** Recent studies leverage neural networks to capture contextual features around potential trigger words to classify events [Chen et al., 2015; Sha et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2016; Lou et al., 2021]. Pre-trained language models like BERT further enhance these models [Yang et al., 2019; Wadden et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2020]. However, these methods require large amounts of labeled data and struggle with new event types.

* **Few-Shot Learning for Event Detection:** Few-shot learning aims to train models with limited labeled data (support set) and predict labels for unseen data (query set). Existing approaches include metric-based [Vinyals et al., 2016; Snell et al., 2017; Garcia and Bruna, 2012; Sung et al., 2018], optimization-based [Finn et al., 2017; Nichol et al., 2018; Ravi and Larochelle, 2016], and model-based methods [Yan et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018b; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018a]. A key challenge is limited sample diversity within the support set, leading to poor model robustness.

* **Addressing Sample Diversity with External Knowledge:** Borrowing from Bayesian meta-learning [Ravi and Larochelle, 2016; Yoon et al., 2018], the authors propose incorporating external knowledge (FrameNet) to augment the support set for event detection. This approach addresses the issue of insufficient sample diversity but needs to consider potential semantic gaps between the knowledge base and target event types.
