**Approaches to Compositional Generalization:**

- **Guo et al. (2020), Das et al. (2021), and Herzig et al. (2021):** Explored various approaches to compositional generalization, particularly addressing challenges posed by the CFQ dataset. Their specific contributions are detailed in Section 4 of their respective works.

- **Grammar Induction:**
  - **Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005):** Introduced grammar induction methods which derive grammar rules directly from question-query pairs, assuming a limited set of grammar rules to bootstrap the model. They search grammar spaces to find grammars facilitating successful parsing of observed questions.
  - **Nye et al. (2020) and Chen et al. (2020):** Applied grammar induction techniques to the SCAN dataset, demonstrating different extents of success in solving it.

**Challenges and Advantages of Grammar Induction:**
- Grammar induction methods have the potential to identify the complete set of transformation rules, enabling perfect compositional generalization. However, their search-based nature limits scalability to long sentences due to the vast size of search spaces.

**Neural Network Architectures for Semantic Parsing:**
- Various neural network architectures have been proposed to incorporate different query structures:
  - **Tree Structures (Dong and Lapata, 2016):** Introduced architectures that incorporate tree structures.
  - **Graph Structures (Buys and Blunsom, 2017; Damonte et al., 2017; Lyu and Titov, 2018; Fancellu et al., 2019):** Explored neural network architectures incorporating graph structures in semantic parsing.
- However, architectures solely incorporating query structures without considering syntactic structures in questions may be insufficient for compositional generalization, as indicated by an ablation study.

**Attention Mechanisms and Part-of-Speech Tags:**
- **Russin et al. (2019):** Proposed improving compositional generalization of seq2seq models using attention mechanisms, focusing on token-level attention.
- **Gordon et al. (2020):** Utilized part-of-speech (PoS) tags to achieve some level of invariance among words sharing the same PoS.

**Dataset Splitting Strategies:**
- **Keysers et al. (2020):** Introduced a strategy in semantic parsing to split datasets, ensuring training and test sets contain no common SQL patterns.
- **Finegan-Dollak et al. (2018):** Proposed a similar strategy, increasing task difficulty by splitting datasets to prevent common SQL patterns. However, neural networks can still relatively easily solve tasks using the "mix-and-match" strategy, as discussed by Lake and Baroni (2018).

## Key Concepts in Compositional Generalization for Semantic Parsing

**2. Grammar Induction**

* Authors: Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005)
* Contribution: Proposed a grammar induction method that learns a limited set of grammar rules and searches for grammars that can parse observed questions.

* Authors: Nye et al. (2020) and Chen et al. (2020)

**5. Splitting Datasets by SQL Patterns**

* Authors: Finegan-Dollak et al. (2018)
* Contribution: Proposed splitting datasets such that training and test sets do not contain common SQL patterns to increase task difficulty. However, the paper argues that similar substructures might still allow neural networks to solve tasks using a "mix-and-match" strategy [2].
